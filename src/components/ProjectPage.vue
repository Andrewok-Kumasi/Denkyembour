            <h2>Preamble</h2>
            <p>
                The Denkyembour Bible and Faith Series is an initiative born out of the ardent desire of the author to
                contribute to bringing the riches of the Word of God, embedded and treasured in Sacred Scripture, to the
                concrete, day-to-day life situations and doorsteps of all Catholics, other Christians, and people of
                Goodwill.
                This project focuses primarily on “Print Evangelisation”, that is, attention is given to the use of the
                various
                forms of print media1 to propagate God’s Word. In this light, the different shades of publication that are
                done
                in this series capture various themes such as biblical, pastoral, theological, mariological,
                ecclesiological,
                catechetical, leadership, canonical etc. issues. This series is not a Bulletin, Newspaper, Journal etc. but
                a
                brand designation (name) for all the publications that will be done in supporting the promotion of the
                agenda of
                the Mission of Evangelisation of the Church.

            <h2>Motivation for the term Denkyembour</h2>
            <p>Different shades of motivation underly the choice of the official nomenclature “Denkyembour”, but two are
                very
                fundamental. Firstly, the term is a Twi word (an Akan language)1 which derives from two other Twi words,
                namely,
                “denkyem” (meaning “crocodile”) and “bour” (meaning “stone”): this is the traditional Akan rendition of the
                English term “Diamond”. It is widely held that diamonds, like crocodiles in water, notwithstanding how long
                they
                are embedded in the ground, do not lose their quality, finesse, compatibility, brilliance, and charm.
                Diamonds
                have the following unique properties: hardness, low coefficient of friction, high thermal conductivity, high
                electrical resistivity, low thermal expansion coefficient, high strength, broad optical transparency from
                ultraviolet to infra-red, resistant to chemical corrosion and biologically compatible.2 In other words, they
                are
                naturally unchangeable, refined, resistant, resilient, strong, compatible, and ever new. These are precisely
                descriptions of the TRUTHS of Sacred Scripture. The eternal, unchangeable, refined, resilient, compatible,
                and
                ever new TRUTHS which God’s Word communicates to us through the Bible are like diamonds which are
                “profitable
                for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness” (see 2 Timothy 3:16). Secondly,
                the
                word is chosen in acknowledgement, homage and gratitude to the people and place (town) where the author was
                born
                and brought up, Akwatia, a place where diamonds were (and are) mined in commercial quantities. The
                Denkyembour
                Bible and Faith Series offers creative and new ways of contributing meaningfully to the entire mission of
                Evangelisation of the Church.

            <h2>Areas of Research and Publications</h2>
            <p>
                The publications in this series are basically categorised under three (3) strategic broad departments:
                A. Academic (Scholarship),
                B. Doctrinal (Theology & Doctrine),
                C. Formative (Ongoing Pastoral Formation).
                These will be the principal categories which will inform the various materials that will be published. Under
                these three categories, certain important themes and questions from the following disciplines will be
                examined:
                Sacred Scripture, Theology (Systematic & Dogmatic), Mariology, Ecclesiology, Biblical Apostolate, Catechesis
                et
                cetera.

            <p>
                The Denkyembour Bible and Faith Series offers a propitious platform and channel for different shades of
                publication which contribute to the propagation of Christian Faith and Doctrine. The Bible is the Word of
                God in
                the words of men. In discerning the Word of God in Sacred Scripture, this project seeks to seize the
                opportunity
                to shed light on how God’s Word constitutes the foundation and source of Christian Faith and Doctrine.
